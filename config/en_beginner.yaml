scenarios.EO.surface.title: Surface mapping
scenarios.EO.surface.description: Measure the varying height of land and oceans over the Earth's surface.
scenarios.EO.surface.req.radar-alt.label: To measure the height of the ground in very high resolution.
scenarios.EO.surface.req.radar-alt.error: You do not have a way to measure the height of the ground in very high resolution.
scenarios.EO.surface.req.dish.label: The Radar altimeter requires a radar dish to work.
scenarios.EO.surface.req.dish.error: Your radar altimeter cannot work as it does not have a radar dish.
scenarios.EO.surface.req.radio-tx.label: A way to transmit signals.
scenarios.EO.surface.req.radio-tx.error: You do not have a way to transmit signals to the ground.
scenarios.EO.surface.req.sat-tracker.label: Enables high level precision of the satellite location.
scenarios.EO.surface.req.sat-tracker.error: You do not have a way to locate the position of the satellite accurately. #If this is staying as a new instrument, need to add as a package option.
scenarios.EO.surface.req.orbit.label: See detail of planet surface.
scenarios.EO.surface.req.orbit.error: The orbit you have chosen does not allow you to see the planet surface in enough detail.
